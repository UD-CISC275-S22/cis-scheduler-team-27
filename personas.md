# Team 27 Personas

### Jim Morrison, Switching Majors
* **Who are you?** I am a second year at University of Delaware. I originially was a Civil Engineer major, but I decided to switch to Computer Science after taking basic programming classes.

* **What’s your main goal?** I have already spent two years of my time here at UD in a major I do not want. I want to see what classes I need to graduate and make a schedule so I can graduate as soon as I can so I don't lose more time and money taking courses I do not need.

* **What’s your main barrier to achieving this goal?** I am having trouble coordinating times to meet with the advisor, so I have to pick my classes on my own. I want to formulate a graduuation plan so I can make up for lost time.


### Tom Petty, Deploying Reservist

* **Who are you?** I am an U.S. Army Reservist and a Junior at UD. My unit is being deployed, so I will miss a 2 semesters of college. 

* **What’s your main goal?** I would like to plan ahead and see what classes I need to take when I get back so I have a clear cut plan to graduate.

* **What’s your main barrier to achieving this goal?** Looking at classes a year out is difficult to plan for. Spending a year away from college and programming makes it hard to remember everything from previous classes. I do not want to take any courses that heavily build on eachother before I deploy.

### Layne Staley, Picking a Concentration

* **Who are you?** I am a second year student at University of Delaware. I'm getting ready to start taking upper level C.S. classes but I'm not sure which concentration I should take.

* **What’s your main goal?** I would like to compare different Computer Science concentration requirements to see which concentration I am most interested in. Looking at the schedules could be very useful to see which classes I need to take for each concentration, and the order I need to take them in.

* **What’s your main barrier to achieving this goal?** Looking at the degree audit makes it difficult to visualize the classes I need to graduate for each concentration.

### Hank Williams, Freshman

* **Who are you?** I am a freshman at University of Delaware. I talked briefly with my advisor and I know I need to take CISC 108 this fall, but I don't know what other classes I should take.

* **What’s your main goal?** I'd like to see which classes I should take besides CISC 108, and would like to build a manageable schedule for the fall.

* **What’s your main barrier to achieving this goal?** It's hard to remember which classes are pre reqs for other classes, and which classes are Computer Science requirements. I would like to make a schedule so I can see which classes I need to start towards my C.S. degree are UD.
